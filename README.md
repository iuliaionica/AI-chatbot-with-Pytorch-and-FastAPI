The goal of the project is to build a chatbot that:

    * Understands user intent using a simple Naive Bayes classifier.

    * Responds with human-like messages generated by GPT-2 (via Hugging Face Transformers).

    * Is deployed as an API using FastAPI.
    
    Project Structure
The project contains the following files:
-main.py               ← FastAPI app (entry point)
-intent_classifier.py  ← Text classification logic
-response_generator.py ← GPT-2 response generation logic
-requirements.txt      ← List of dependencies
-data/intents.csv       ← Example dataset for training intent classifier

The first step is to install all the libraries using the following command in a terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt

The intent_classifier converts text to vectors using TF-IDF, trains on intents.csv . The function predict_intent() takes new text and predicts its category (intent).

The response_generator loads GPT-2 with tokenizer, takes a text prompt like "Intent: reset_password\nUser: I forgot my password\nBot:", generates a short reply.

The main.py, the FastAPI app:

    •     Accepts POST requests at /chat/.
      
    •     Gets user message, predicts intent.
      
    •     Builds a prompt and passes it to GPT-2.
      
    •     Returns a chatbot-like response.


How to run the API: from inside the project folder run the following command in a terminal: uvicorn main:app --reload  
Then visit:http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Here you can test the chatbot using FastAPI's auto-generated Swagger UI.


The project works in the following way: 

    •     You send a message (e.g., “Can I get a refund?”) via a POST request.
      
    •     FastAPI:
            
               - Validates the message.
        
               - Passes it to the classifier.
            
    •     The classifier predicts the intent (e.g., “refund_policy”).
      
    •     GPT-2 generates a reply based on the prompt that includes the intent and user’s message.
      
    •     FastAPI returns the intent and the GPT-2 reply in the response.
